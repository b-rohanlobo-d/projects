As Emma sifts through her mother's possessions, she uncovers old letters, photographs, and mementos that hint at a life full of secrets and untold stories. These discoveries set Emma on a path of introspection and reconciliation, where she must confront her own feelings of guilt, loss, and the what-ifs of their relationship. The silence that once seemed impenetrable now beckons Emma to uncover the truth about her mother's past and her own place within it.</p>
